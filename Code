\section*{Education}
I graduated Merced High School in 2019. Last semester, I took Writing 10, Introduction to Logic, Cognitive Science, and Mechanical Engineering (this one was my favorite). In Mechanical Engineering, I was introduced to coding and learned Python and MATLAB.

\section*{Work Experience}
During the summer of 2018, I worked at a French restaurant in Washington D.C. called Bistrot du Coin. In the summer of 2019, I worked at the Merced College pool as a swim and diving instructor for children. I also worked as a lifeguard.

\section*{Hobbies}
During my spare time I enjoy drawing and writing. Any ideas that I get, I either write down or draw. My favorite things to draw are cartoons and my favorite subject to write about is fiction.
